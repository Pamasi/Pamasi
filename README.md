# Computer Engineer with a Passion for AI and Perception

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a computer engineering student with a strong passion for artificial intelligence, especially in the realm of perception applications

## About Me

I'm a computer engineer who has honed my skills through practical experience. I started my journey as UAV Perception Engineer for  night vision system and then later joined the Formula SAE competion as LiDAR Perception Engineer. All these experience taught me the importance of real-world  AI applications and teamwork. Currently, I am doing my master thesis on  explainable AI-driven  models to improve safety of autonomous driving perception systems.

## Current Projects

### Project: [Cross-Domain Object Detection for UAV-based Thermal Imaging](https://github.com/Pamasi/tir_cross_domain#cross-domain-object-detection-for-uav-based-thermal-imaging)
- **Description**: This project aims to train a YOLOv7 to detect object from UAV at low-flight condition, exploting different point of view during training.

- **Status**: Done. Find the code and documentation in the repository.

### Project: Neuro-symbolic based sentence mathcing

- **Description**: In the planning phase, this project will integrated prior-knowledge into a transformer-based encoder for sentence matching.

- **Status**: Stay tuned for updates.

### Project: [Empowering safety in Thermal Imaging using Rust](https://github.com/Pamasi/yolo_tir_rust)

- **Description**: In the planning phase, this project will create an efficient framework to inference ours UAV-based Thermal Imaging detector based on Rust, even using ROS 2.

- **Status**: Stay tuned for updates.
