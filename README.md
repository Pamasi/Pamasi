# System Engineer - Computational Imaging

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a System Engineer specializing in Computer Vision and Sensor Fusion for Autonomous Driving.

## Current Projects

### Project: [Cross-Domain Object Detection for UAV-based Thermal Imaging](https://github.com/Pamasi/tir_cross_domain#cross-domain-object-detection-for-uav-based-thermal-imaging)
- **Description**: This project aims to train a YOLOv7 to detect objects from UAV at low-flight conditions, exploiting different points of view during training.

- **Status**: Done. Find the code and documentation in the repository.
  
### Project: [Scene Graph Generation in Autonomous Driving: a neuro-symbolic approach](https://github.com/Pamasi/sgg_av)

- **Description**: This project integrates prior knowledge into Scene Graph Generation using a neuro-symbolic approach based on Logit Tensor Network and Knowledge Graph Embedding
- **Status**: Done. Find the code and documentation in the repository.
  
### Project: [Empowering safety in Thermal Imaging using Rust](https://github.com/Pamasi/yolo_tir_rust/tree/main)

- **Description**: This project builds an efficient framework to inference our UAV-based Thermal Imaging detector based on Rust using ROS 2.

- **Status**: Done. Find the code and documentation in the repository.
