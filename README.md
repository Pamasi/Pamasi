# Computer Engineer with a Passion for AI application in Autonomous Driving

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a computer engineering student with practical experience as a Perception Engineer.

## What Drives Me

- **Autonomous Driving**: My experience as a Perception Engineer has fueled my passion for AI in the context of autonomous driving. I'm enthusiastic about the potential for technology to revolutionize transportation, making it safer, more efficient, and accessible.

- **Explainable AI**: My current focus is on creating AI models that are transparent and interpretable, contributing to the trust and safety of autonomous driving systems.

## Current Projects

### Project: [Interpretable Perception Models for Autonomous Vehicles]
- **Description**: This project aims to train a YOLOv7 to detect objects from UAV at low-flight conditions, exploiting different points of view during training.

- **Status**: Done. Find the code and documentation in the repository.

### Project: "Efficient GPT-2 Inference"

- **Description**: In the planning phase, this project will create an efficient framework to use Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) on low-resource hardware.

- **Status**: Stay tuned for updates.
