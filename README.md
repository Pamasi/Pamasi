# Computer Engineer with a Passion for AI and Perception

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a computer engineering with a strong passion for artificial intelligence, especially in the realm of perception applications

## About Me

I'm a computer engineer who has honed my skills through practical experience. I started my journey as UAV Perception Engineer for  night vision systems and later joined the Formula SAE competition as LiDAR Perception Engineer. All these experiences taught me the importance of real-world  AI applications and teamwork.

## Current Projects

### Project: [Cross-Domain Object Detection for UAV-based Thermal Imaging](https://github.com/Pamasi/tir_cross_domain#cross-domain-object-detection-for-uav-based-thermal-imaging)
- **Description**: This project aims to train a YOLOv7 to detect objects from UAV at low-flight conditions, exploiting different points of view during training.

- **Status**: Done. Find the code and documentation in the repository.

### Project: Scene Graph Generation in Autonomous Driving: a neuro-symbolic approach

- **Description**: This project aims to integrate prior knowledge into Scene Graph Generation using a neuro-symbolic approach based on Logit Tensor Network and Knowledge Graph Embedding
- **Status**: Under review, stay tuned for updates.

### Project: Neuro-symbolic based sentence matching

- **Description**: In the planning phase, this project will integrate prior knowledge into a transformer-based encoder for sentence matching.

- **Status**: Stay tuned for updates.

### Project: [Empowering safety in Thermal Imaging using Rust](https://github.com/Pamasi/yolo_tir_rust)

- **Description**: This project will create an efficient framework to inference our UAV-based Thermal Imaging detector based on Rust using ROS 2.

- **Status**: Working progress.
