# System Engineer - Computational Imaging

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a System Engineer specializing in Computer Vision and Sensor Fusion for Autonomous Driving.

## Current Projects

### Project: [Cross-Domain Object Detection for UAV-based Thermal Imaging](https://github.com/Pamasi/tir_cross_domain#cross-domain-object-detection-for-uav-based-thermal-imaging)
- **Description**: This project aims to train a YOLOv7 to detect objects from UAV at low-flight conditions, exploiting different points of view during training.

- **Status**: Done. Find the code and documentation in the repository.
  
### Project: [Scene Graph Generation in Autonomous Driving: a neuro-symbolic approach](https://github.com/Pamasi/sgg_av)

- **Description**: This project integrates prior knowledge into Scene Graph Generation using a neuro-symbolic approach based on Logic Tensor Network and Knowledge Graph Embedding
- **Status**: Done. Find the code and documentation in the repository.
  
### Project: [Sentence-BERT driven by Neuro-symbolic AI](https://github.com/Pamasi/phrase_matching_ltn/tree/develop)

- **Description**: This project aims to train a neuro-symbolic model used to participate in the competition "U.S. Patent Phrase to Phrase Matching.

- **Status**: Under Review. Stay tune for the final release!
  
### Project: [Physics-Informed Neural Network for RADAR Tracking](https://github.com/Pamasi/pinn_kkl_observer/tree/develop)

- **Description**: This project aims to design a Deep Learning-based Non-Linear Observer for RADAR Tracking imposing physical constraints to ease model explainability.

- **Status**: In Progress.
