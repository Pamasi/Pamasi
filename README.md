# Computer Engineer with a Passion for AI and Perception

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a computer engineer student with a strong passion for artificial intelligence, especially in the realm of perception applications

## About Me

I'm a computer engineer who has honed my skills through practical experience. I started my journey with a fascination for technology's transformative potential and have grown into a dedicated AI enthusiast, determined to make an impact in this dynamic field.

## Experience
- **UAV Perception Engineer**: I have hands-on experience as a Perception Engineer on a Formula Student Driverless team, Squadra Corse Driverless PoliTO, where I worked on night vision systems.
- **Formula SAE Perception Engineer**: I have hands-on experience as a Perception Engineer on a Formula Student Driverless team, Squadra Corse Driverless PoliTO, where I worked on developing perception systems for high-performance racing vehicles during.
- All these experience taught me the importance of real-world  AI applications and teamwork.

## What Drives Me

- **Autonomous Driving**: My passion has led me to explore the intersection of AI and autonomous driving. I'm excited about how technology can revolutionize transportation, making it safer, more efficient, and accessible.

- **Explainable AI**: My current focus is on creating AI models that are transparent and interpretable, contributing to the trust and safety of autonomous driving systems.

## Current Projects

### Project: [Interpretable Perception Models for Autonomous Vehicles](https://github.com/Pamasi/tir_cross_domain#cross-domain-object-detection-for-uav-based-thermal-imaging)

- **Description**: This project aims to train a YOLOv7 to detect object from UAV at low-flight condition, exploting different point of view during training.

- **Status**: Done. Find the code and documentation in the repository.

### Project: "Efficient GPT-2 inference"

- **Description**: In the planning phase, this project will an efficient framework to use Generative Pre-trained Transformer(GPT) on low-resource hardware.

- **Status**: Stay tuned for updates.
